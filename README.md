# productivity-tools

My random coding experiments and tools for developer quality-of-life.

Sometimes I get distracted or can't focus, so I build things to help with that. Why? Because it's fun, and I don't want to get fired.

_Here's a cat, because this is the internet and I'm not one to tempt fate._
